# High performace web server setup

## Introduction

This is a set of configuration files for the Linux kernel that allow
to setup a high-performance web server and accompanying DB server.

It follows the debian setup where there's a directory `/etc/sysctl.d`
where you place **all** your kernel configuration parameters files
with names descriptive of which subsystem of the kernel it relates to.

## Installation

 1. Clone the repo:
        
        git clone git://github.com/perusio/high-performance-web-kernel-parameters.git 

 2. Choose the configuration based on the type of role that your
    server will play **web server** or **DB server**.

 3. Copy from the directory `webserver` (for web servers) to
    `/etc/sysctl.d`.
    
    Copy from the directory `dbserver` (for DB servers) to
    `/etc/sysctl.d`  

 4. Update the kernel config using:
        
        sysctl --system
        
 5. Done

This are the system limits and also there is user limits (ulimit cmd to request data).

To increase number of open file descriptors you need to increase this limits in /etc/security/limits.conf

And example of it is in limits/limits.conf
 
Note that from now on, this configuation will be used for setting the
kernel parameters at boot time.
  
## TODO
 
Improve the documentation. Add Intel paper discussion for better understanding.
